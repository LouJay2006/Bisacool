          <h3>Kawasan Falls — Badian</h3>
          <p>Kawasan Falls is Cebu’s most iconic waterfall, famous for its turquoise blue water that looks almost unreal in photos. Located in Badian, this multi-layered cascade is part of the Matutinao River system. It’s easy to access and perfect for a refreshing dip after a short 15-minute walk from the highway. Locals and tourists alike enjoy canyoneering here — jumping, sliding, and trekking through the river system all the way down to the main pool. Visit early in the morning for quieter moments and magical light rays piercing through the trees.</p>

          <h3>Tumalog Falls — Oslob</h3>
          <p>Tumalog Falls is one of the most photogenic waterfalls in southern Cebu. With its thin, veil-like streams gracefully draping over mossy rocks, it looks like something out of a fantasy movie. Located just a few minutes from Oslob town proper — the same area known for whale shark watching — Tumalog offers a calm, cooling experience. The water here is shallow and gentle, ideal for relaxation rather than swimming. The best time to visit is early morning when the mist and sunlight create a magical atmosphere under the towering cliffs.</p>

          <h3>Dao Falls — Samboan</h3>
          <p>Dao Falls is a hidden gem in southern Cebu, tucked deep within lush greenery in the town of Samboan. Getting here requires a 20–30 minute trek that winds through bamboo bridges and river crossings, rewarding you with a stunning, narrow canyon leading to the waterfall itself. The main fall drops dramatically into a wide turquoise basin surrounded by limestone walls. It’s peaceful, secluded, and feels untouched by modern crowds — the kind of spot where you can hear nothing but the sound of the rushing water.</p>

          <h3>Inambakan Falls — Ginatilan</h3>
          <p>Inambakan Falls in Ginatilan offers five levels of waterfalls, each with its own character and view. The first tier — the main one — has a powerful 100-foot drop into a bright blue pool perfect for swimming. As you climb higher, smaller cascades await, great for cliff-jumping or simply relaxing by the rocks. The area is surrounded by dense jungle, butterflies, and the sound of birds echoing through the cliffs. It’s ideal for those who love hiking and exploring beyond the usual tourist trails.</p>
